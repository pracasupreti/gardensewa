    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Vertical Gardening</h2>
    <p>Transform dull walls and fences into vibrant vertical gardens using a mix of hanging baskets, tiered shelves, or mounted planters. This method is perfect for maximizing limited space in urban Nepali homes. Incorporating vines, herbs, and flowering plants not only adds visual appeal but also helps purify the air and insulate walls, creating a cooler, greener atmosphere.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Balcony Planters</h2>
    <p>Convert your balcony into a serene green retreat by adding rail-mounted planters, corner stands, and cascading pots. Add a mix of ornamental and edible plants to create a functional and calming space. With thoughtful placement and seasonal selections, balconies can become tiny ecosystems buzzing with butterflies, bees, and fresh fragrances.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Raised Bed Gardening</h2>
    <p>Raised beds are ideal for rooftops, courtyards, or small front yards. They allow you to control soil quality, manage weeds, and ensure proper drainage. With neatly arranged beds, you can grow vegetables, herbs, and flowers in organized rows—easy to maintain and harvest. Wooden or brick-edged beds can also enhance your garden’s aesthetic.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Indoor Herb Gardens</h2>
    <p>Bring nature into your home by growing herbs like tulsi, mint, or rosemary on your kitchen windowsill or living room shelf. Use ceramic pots, tin cans, or glass jars to give your herb garden a personal touch. These mini gardens not only provide fresh seasoning at your fingertips but also add life and aroma to your interiors.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Use Multipurpose Tools</h2>
    <p>Gardening in small spaces requires efficiency. Equip yourself with multipurpose tools—such as a combination trowel and weeder, or foldable stools with storage. These smart tools save space and make gardening easier, especially for beginners or those managing compact gardens. Choose durable, ergonomic tools to enjoy a stress-free gardening experience.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Top Tools Every Gardener Needs</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
      <li><strong>Pruning Shears:</strong> Perfect for shaping plants, removing dead stems, and encouraging healthy regrowth. A sharp pair of shears makes precise cuts that help plants recover quickly and flourish.</li>
      <li><strong>Hand Trowel:</strong> This compact tool is essential for digging, transplanting, and breaking up soil. Ideal for use in containers and raised beds, a sturdy trowel speeds up your planting tasks significantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Watering Can/Spray:</strong> Ensure proper hydration by using a watering can with a long spout or a gentle mist spray for delicate seedlings. Consistent watering is crucial to help young plants establish roots and thrive.</li>
      <li><strong>Gardening Gloves:</strong> Keep your hands safe from thorns, rough soil, and insects. Choose gloves made from breathable, durable materials for maximum comfort and grip.</li>
      <li><strong>Weeder:</strong> A simple yet effective tool for uprooting weeds without disturbing your crops. Handy for keeping small garden beds clean and healthy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Organic Soils & Fertilizers</h2>
    <p>Healthy soil is the foundation of a thriving garden. GardenSewa provides premium compost, vermicompost, and biofertilizers designed to improve soil texture, retain moisture, and supply essential nutrients without harmful chemicals. These organic options are safe for the environment, children, and pets—supporting long-term sustainability in your gardening journey.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Stylish Pots & Planters</h2>

    fullContent: `
    <section>
      
      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 1: Assess Your Space and Light</h2>
      <p>
        Identify the available space for your garden — balconies, rooftops, or small yards. Observe the sunlight patterns, as most vegetables require at least 5-6 hours of sunlight daily.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 2: Choose Suitable Containers and Soil</h2>
      <p>
        Use pots, raised beds, or recycled containers. Fill them with high-quality, nutrient-rich soil mixed with compost to ensure healthy plant growth.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 3: Select Easy-to-Grow Vegetables</h2>
      <p>
        Start with hardy, fast-growing vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and green chilies. These crops adapt well to container gardening and Kathmandu's climate.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 4: Watering and Maintenance</h2>
      <p>
        Water your plants regularly but avoid overwatering. Mulch to retain moisture and reduce weeds. Regularly check for pests and use organic methods for control.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 5: Harvesting and Enjoying Your Garden</h2>
      <p>
        Harvest vegetables when they reach maturity. Fresh homegrown produce tastes better and is free from harmful chemicals.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Starting a home garden in Kathmandu is a fulfilling way to connect with nature, improve your diet, and beautify your living space. GardenSewa can assist you with expert advice, design, and maintenance to make your urban garden flourish.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 3: Select Easy-to-Grow Vegetables</h2>
      <p>
        Start with hardy, fast-growing vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and green chilies. These crops adapt well to container gardening and Kathmandu's climate.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 4: Watering and Maintenance</h2>
      <p>
        Water your plants regularly but avoid overwatering. Mulch to retain moisture and reduce weeds. Regularly check for pests and use organic methods for control.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Step 5: Harvesting and Enjoying Your Garden</h2>
      <p>
        Harvest vegetables when they reach maturity. Fresh homegrown produce tastes better and is free from harmful chemicals.
